<p>Once upon a time, there was a couple named Kris and Sarah. They had been together for several years and had a loving and fulfilling relationship. However, like many couples, they fell into a common trap that threatened to destroy their bond.</p>
<p>It all started when Kris and Sarah began keeping score of their contributions to the relationship. They would silently tally up everything they had done for each other and compare it, always feeling like they were doing more than the other. They would list the chores they had completed, the bills they had paid, the sacrifices they had made, and they would dwell on these lists, feeling unappreciated and resentful.</p>
<p>Sarah, in particular, would regularly express her dissatisfaction with Kris, reminding him of how he failed to meet her expectations and how she had done so much more for their relationship. This constant comparison and criticism caused tension and negativity to seep into their once loving partnership.</p>
<p>As time went on, Sarah's frustration grew, and she found herself becoming increasingly angry at Kris. The love she once felt for him started to fade away, replaced by resentment. Sarah failed to realize the strong connection between her thoughts and her emotions. The more she dwelled on the perceived injustice of their division of labor, the heavier her thoughts weighed on her, making her feel used and drained.</p>
<p>On the other side, Kris began to feel the hatred and tension emanating from Sarah. He resented being belittled and blamed for not contributing enough. He felt defensive and unappreciated, which only widened the gap between them. Both of them were keeping score, adding up the points on their respective "scorecards," and blaming each other for their perceived shortcomings.</p>
<p>One day, Sarah came across an article that challenged this destructive habit. It urged couples to throw away their scorecards and instead focus on love and appreciation. Intrigued, she shared it with Kris, and they decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>They made a conscious effort to shift their thinking. Instead of dwelling on what the other person hadn't done, they started acknowledging and appreciating what they had done. They realized that a significant portion of their frustration was based on their own mental habits rather than a true imbalance in their relationship. Every time they discarded thoughts of "this isn't fair," they were making a positive contribution to their relationship.</p>
<p>Kris and Sarah learned that it was easier to count their own contributions and assume that their partner was doing what they should be doing. They recognized that keeping score only led to negativity and distance between them. By focusing on love and gratitude, they could rekindle the flame of their relationship.</p>
<p>They didn't deny that they still occasionally fell into the scorekeeping trap, but it happened less frequently as time went on. They knew that as long as their hearts were filled with love and patience, they could communicate openly and resolve any difficulties they faced. Kris and Sarah understood that shutting out the tendency to keep score was essential to maintaining a strong and loving bond.</p>
<p>With this newfound understanding, Kris and Sarah were able to let go of their grievances and embrace a relationship based on love, respect, and appreciation. Their love for each other grew stronger, and they lived happily ever after, knowing that the real key to a fulfilling relationship was not keeping score but cherishing and nurturing their love.</p></div>
