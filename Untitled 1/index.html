<p>Once upon a time, in the era of constant exchange, where we always strive for more, there lived a community. They believed in the notion of "bigger and better" and sought to acquire more possessions. They exchanged small houses for larger ones, old cars for newer ones. They desired better jobs, higher incomes, larger retirement plans, and more valuable experiences. They wanted to have better bodies and be part of the best fitness clubs. Everyone also longed for more advanced computers that could do more things faster. However, within a year or two, those computers would become outdated. The popular motto was "New and Improved" and "Discard the old, buy the new." If they believed the advertisements, they would imagine that the best solution to financial shortcomings was to get a bigger loan. In doing so, they could schedule their debt while simultaneously acquiring things they didn't yet possess.</p>
<p>They always desired this and that, constantly seeking to have more. There was always another item that seemed superior. It's no wonder that this unconscious neurotic tendency was unknowingly transmitted to their partners. The belief that "others have something better" was ingrained in their way of thinking. Perhaps they sometimes viewed their partners through this lens as well. Maybe others were more attractive or beautiful and could be better partners. Or maybe someone else would treat them better, listen to them more attentively. Perhaps, with a different partner, their needs would be met more often, and finally, they could feel satisfied. These thoughts were reinforced by television shows where nearly everyone was either cheating or finding new partners. No one seemed capable of long-lasting contentment.</p>
<p>While it's possible that a new partner could be the best solution, it's an exception, not a universal formula. You might not be feeling "empty" or seeking a new partner, but it's important for you to realize that merely contemplating such possibilities hinders your ability to enjoy what you already have and impedes the growth of your relationship. If you continue to focus on what could be better or compare what you have (or who you have) with fantasies about someone (or something) else, you'll always feel disappointed and frustrated.</p>
<p>You'll be helped if you can recognize and accept that often, fantasies are more beautiful than reality. We have met many men and women who left their partners for someone younger, more attractive, caring, or wealthier, among other reasons. Without exception, those fantasies were more beautiful than reality. A new partner might appear delightful, but like all of us, they also have their problems. With a new partner, new problems arise. Many people say, "If I were with someone else, I wouldn't have to accept this situation." That may be true, but don't forget that you would also have to accept a new set of circumstances. I assure you, there is no place free from problems.</p>
<p>This advice is incredibly helpful if you want to feel more peaceful and content in your relationship. It is also easy to practice. All you need to do is be mindful and aware of the tendency to think that someone else would be better. It is simple and not difficult at all. If you catch yourself thinking in that way, try doing something different. Don't clutter your mind with thoughts of what or who might be better, but instead, find ways to improve the relationship you are already in. Be grateful for what you have now, and you may discover that the grass in the neighbor's yard is not always greener.</p></div>
