<p>Just forget about it.
Once upon a time, in a small town, there lived a woman named Mei. She had been married to her husband, Adam, for several years, and they had always been a loving and supportive couple. However, lately, Mei had been plagued by doubts and insecurities.</p>
<p>One day, as Mei was driving her car and listening to an interactive talk show on the radio, she couldn't help but relate to the callers who were expressing their relationship concerns. Within half an hour, three different people called in to complain about something their partners had done, or possibly done, in the past.</p>
<p>The first caller, a woman, complained that her husband might have cheated on her with another woman about two years ago. She was obsessed with the issue, unable to forget about it, and wondered what she should do. The second caller complained that a few years ago, her husband had grown distant and stopped listening to her. She had been trying to recall if she had done something wrong herself. She felt like she was playing a constant game of mental ping-pong, saying, "Maybe this happened, maybe that." Finally, a man called in to express his frustration because, during the first year of their marriage, his wife had accumulated a massive credit card debt. He couldn't sleep at night, worrying that she wouldn't be able to break that habit and learn from the experience. He was still angry with his wife because "what she did jeopardized their future."</p>
<p>Mei couldn't help but feel frustrated with the situation and wanted to shout, "Just forget about it!" However, the radio host didn't offer that advice. Instead, he encouraged the three callers to review and analyze their issues. His advice only made them more confused, scared, and unsettled. The radio host said, "Have you considered the possibility of a certain thing?" and "Oh my God, I've heard of cases like that. You should..."</p>
<p>Before I continue, let me assure you that I don't consider extramarital affairs, neglect, and overspending as minor issues. These three things can, and often do, become significant problems in marriages or other forms of relationships. Unfortunately, most people ignore the negative effects of dwelling on past problems until they truly become major issues. People also overlook the consequences of refusing to let go of old problems for the sake of preserving their relationships. We forget how challenging it is to live with someone who constantly brings up the past and can't let go of old issues. We fail to realize how difficult it is to continue loving someone who makes unreasonable demands and can't accept the fact that we are all human. There is an appropriate expression for the three callers and all of us: "What's done is done."</p>
<p>Focusing on past issues in a relationship already presents many challenges without the need to keep dredging up old problems. It is important for you to remind yourself of what happens to your ability to love, forgive, and grow when your mind is filled with old garbage. Generally, when your mind is constantly filled with something that reminds you of past problems, you become anxious, suspicious, and frustratedâ€”only negative things occupy your mind, not love. Frustration can spill over into other aspects of your life, to the point where you easily become angry over "small issues."</p>
<p>We are not talking about avoiding problems here. The fact is, we are all fallible, imperfect, and often misjudge situations. However, the ideal environment that allows us to avoid all that is an environment filled with forgiveness and non-judgment. In other words, if the person you love makes a mistake, your best reaction is to continue loving them, supporting them, and not making a big fuss about their error. By doing so, you will feel relieved, and your partner will feel comfortable discussing</p>
<p>their issues with you, knowing they have your support in their personal development as a couple.</p>
<p>So, if you still harbor old problems in your mind, now is the time to let them go. Don't nurture negative feelings and tension, but make the decision to forgive, forget, and move forward. In return, you will gain a richer, more open, honest, and loving relationship.</p></div>
